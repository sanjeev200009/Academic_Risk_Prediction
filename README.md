# 🎓 Academic Risk Prediction for Sri Lankan Students

This project applies machine learning to predict academic risk levels among students, focusing on the **Sri Lankan context**. It was entirely developed and tested using **Google Colab** for ease of accessibility and includes a Streamlit web interface that can be launched via **ngrok**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To support early intervention in Sri Lankan education by predicting students at academic risk using demographic, regional, and socio-economic features. This project simulates localized features using the UCI Student Performance dataset and demonstrates how ML can address real-world educational challenges.

## 🔁 Project Workflow

1. **📥 Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Dataset: [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)  
   - Combined Math and Portuguese subject data  
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing data

2. **🛠️ Feature Engineering**  
   - Added Sri Lanka–specific features:  
     - `Region`: Urban, Rural, Estate  
     - `Ethnicity`: Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Other  
     - `Economic Status`: Low, Middle, High  

3. **🔄 Preprocessing**  
   - Label Encoding for categorical features  
   - Standardization of numerical attributes  
   - Train-Test Split (80/20)

4. **🤖 Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Models:  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  
     - Logistic Regression  
   - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance  

5. **🌐 Streamlit Deployment**  
   - Built an interactive UI in Streamlit  
   - Runs directly in Colab using `pyngrok`  
   - Accepts student input and provides predictive results + advice  
   - Models and encoders serialized using `joblib`

## 🚀 How to Run

### ✅ Google Colab (Recommended)
You can run the full project including model training and Streamlit deployment directly in Colab:

▶️ **Colab Notebook**:  
📎 [Click to open](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1174fg_ja7j92Icz3WlUZzKDMbnZVMux9?usp=sharing)

1. Run all cells step by step  
2. Click the ngrok link generated by `streamlit run app.py`  
3. Interact with the prediction interface
